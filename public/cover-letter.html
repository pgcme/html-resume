        <h2>Dear Hiring Manager</h2>

        <p>
            It is with great enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position of Customer Service Representative II. I am confident that my professional background, customer service experience and constant pursuit of the highest standards in everything I do, qualify me as a suitable candidate for this position.
        </p>
        <p>
            With over ten years of experience in the tourism industry, I have recently moved to Cochrane, and I am eager to use my communication, attention to detail, and time management skills to make a difference in our community. Having worked for non-profit organizations and provincial government for much of my career, I have found my passion in using my skillset to aid in the betterment of communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through my previous positions I have developed strong communication skills by building and maintaining relationships with stakeholders and creating memorable travel experiences, whilst providing exceptional customer service. As a result of my career development across multiple countries, I have shaped my adaptability and cross-cultural sensitivity skills extensively. I am optimistic, prioritize analytical and solution orientated thinking, and have a dedicated sense of ownership to my work. I am a quick learner and find myself motivated through the pursuit of helping others and contributing to a sustainable future, thus I work best when focusing on the collective outcome of the organization rather than personal achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your time and consideration in reviewing my application. Based on my skillset and values I believe I could be a successful contributing team member to the Town of Cochrane. I am genuinely excited about the potential employment opportunity and would be available to elaborate on any questions you may have.  
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
